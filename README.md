# MLChecker
Non-complete project
Tool for checking python source code.  
Should be trained on some codebase and then checks input files for sequences that are seem to be wrong because such sequence wasn't present in initial codebase.  
There are tests that can be invoked by python3 -m pytest Tests/tests_splitter.py  
It fails though.
